# Untitled Application

## Getting Started

1. You must have the following dependencies installed:

     - Ruby 3 (See [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version))
     - PostgreSQL 13
     - Redis 6.2
     - Node 16 (See [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc))
     - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome) (for headless browser tests)

    If you don't have these installed, you can use [rails.new](https://rails.new) to help with the process.

2. Run the `bin/setup` script.
3. Start the application with `bin/dev`.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000.
