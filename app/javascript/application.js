// ðŸš« DEFAULT RAILS INCLUDES
// This section represents the default includes for a Rails 6.0.0-rc1 application. Bullet Train's includes and your own
// includes should be specified at the end of the file, not in this section. This helps avoid merge conflicts in the
// future should the framework defaults change.

// This file is automatically compiled by Webpack, along with any other files
// present in this directory. You're encouraged to place your actual application logic in
// a relevant structure within app/javascript and only use these pack files to reference
// that code so it'll be compiled.
