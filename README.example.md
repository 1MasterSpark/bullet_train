# Untitled Application

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies

Before you can get started developing, you must have the following dependencies installed:

 - Ruby 3.1
 - PostgreSQL 13
 - Redis 6.2
 - Node 16.14
 - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome) (for headless browser tests)

If you don't have these installed, you can use [rails.new](https://rails.new) to help with the process.

2. Run the setup script: `bin/setup`
3. Start the application: `bin/dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000.
